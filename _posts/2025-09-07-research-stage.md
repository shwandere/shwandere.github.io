I am done with learning...I am not done. I still think learning new topics is important but I have to focus on something else than learning and ideas. and that is being rigorous on a topic. Read, write and think about a topic rigorously and ask questions. I remember that paper on latent disentanglement by rishabh parihar. It was so rigorous. It feels like he just did and did experiments. 

Instead of being perfect in work, I have to be doing more and more work instead of getting ideas.  

I think this is the most important answers from chatgpt for a newbie as a researcher.

# Question : 
I am in 2nd year of phd I have learnt many things like how to read a paper how to find problems pattern recognition and learning new concepts....but i am still not getting confidence there are two thing i want to ask......first how the journey of other phd student like what are the steps in a phd journey where iam in those steps....and how can i improve myself in research like what shouldI do next becasue i have learnt that i cant rely on ideas all the time in research

# Answer : 
This is such a thoughtful question 👏 — it shows you’re reflecting critically, which itself is a _sign of growth as a researcher_. Let me break this down into two parts:

## 1. **PhD Journey – Common Stages**

Every PhD is unique, but many students go through broadly similar phases:

1. **Orientation / Survival (Year 1)**
    
    - Learning how to read papers efficiently.
        
    - Understanding your field and the “big problems.”
        
    - Feeling lost is _normal_ — everything feels too broad.
        
2. **Consolidation (Year 2)** ← _you are here_
    
    - You’ve learned methods, tools, how to scan papers, identify gaps.
        
    - Now comes the **hardest transition**: from being a _learner_ to a _creator_.
        
    - Confidence dips here because you realize: _“I know enough to see how much I don’t know.”_
        
    - Most students underestimate themselves at this point.
        
3. **Direction / First Contributions (Years 2–3)**
    
    - You carve out **a niche problem**.
        
    - You write your first serious paper(s).
        
    - This is where persistence beats inspiration — not every idea works, but persistence yields results.
        
4. **Expansion (Years 3–4)**
    
    - You have a research identity.
        
    - You branch out — combine methods, extend theories, collaborate.
        
5. **Wrapping Up (Final Year)**
    
    - Tie together your thesis story.
        
    - Publish your strongest contributions.
        
    - Think about your “next chapter” (postdoc, industry, etc.).

## 2. **How to Improve Yourself in Research (Next Steps for You)**

Since you’re in **Year 2**, here’s what matters most now:

### 🔎 A. Shift from “learning” → “doing”

- You don’t need to know _everything_ to start producing.
    
- Pick one **well-scoped problem** (even if small!) and aim to solve it with rigor.
    
- Example: Instead of “robust audio-visual learning,” narrow to _“how audio helps recover corrupted video features in sign language recognition.”_
    

### 📚 B. Use papers differently

- Early on: you read to **understand**.
    
- Now: read to **position your work**.
    
    - Where exactly is the gap?
        
    - Who would care about the answer?
        

### 🛠️ C. Build habits of iteration

- Research isn’t about having _brilliant ideas_ all the time.
    
- It’s about **iterating small ideas, running experiments, and refining**.
    
    - 1% improvements compound.
        
    - Even “failed” experiments can become a section of your paper (“we tried X, it failed, so we did Y”).
        

### 💡 D. Work on confidence actively

- Confidence doesn’t come before results — it comes _from small results_.
    
- Set **mini-milestones**:
    
    - Reproduce a paper.
        
    - Run a baseline on your dataset.
        
    - Write a short workshop paper (lower pressure than a top-tier conference).
        

### 🤝 E. Don’t do it alone

- Talk with your advisor, peers, even on forums.
    
- Explaining your work to others is the fastest way to clarify your own thinking.

## 3. **Ideas vs Process**

You’re right — you cannot rely on “grand ideas” all the time.

- Good research is **90% persistence, 10% inspiration**.
    
- The process:
    
    1. Start with a _small, concrete question_.
        
    2. Test it rigorously.
        
    3. Share it, get feedback, refine.
        

That process itself _generates new ideas_ — one solved problem reveals another.

✅ So where are you?

- You’ve already mastered **reading, recognizing patterns, and learning concepts**.
    
- You’re at the **transitional step**: from consuming knowledge to **producing small, testable contributions**.
    
- The next big leap is: **pick one narrow problem and start building + writing**.
