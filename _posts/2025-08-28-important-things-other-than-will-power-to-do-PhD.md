One thing that I am learning and in the last two years that I have learnt is embrace failure. What you fail, you constantly analyse what happened, who was at fault. If you have high self esteem you blame the system. If you have low self esteem like me, you will blame yourself. But above both its about accepting what happened. No I am not saying that be positive always. But be open to failure also as much accepting you are to success. We all the time dream for success. I filled the form for Google PhD fellowship and I all the time dream about how much my confidence will boost up if I get selected. But this is also true that I am not the absolute deserving candidate for it. 

I think that line from Gita that "fal ki chinta kiye bina karm kiye ja" suits the journey of PhD. 

Other than this the source that I found important and I will go to it again and again everytime my will power will not work for me is the source below because I cant rely on my father for motivation all the time.
